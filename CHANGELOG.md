## [2.4.0](https://github.com/homebridge-plugins/homebridge-lutron-caseta-leap/releases/tag/v2.4.0) (2022-07-24)

### What's Changes
- This is a big one, folks! First, a big thank-you to all the users who provided testing and feedback. Now, what's changed?

    - **Pico remotes now support long- and double-press in HomeKit!**
        After you update, you'll see the new options in your HomeKit app. Now you can attach scenes and actions to single-press, double-press, and press-and-hold actions on your Picos. Don't like it? No problem! You can disable them, as well as configure the speeds, individually in the settings. By default, this is turned on after this update.
    - **Picos that are paired in the Lutron app can be hidden!**
        If you've got Picos that already have a job, either set up in the Lutron app or paired directly with a device, you can now exclude/hide them from HomeKit on a global basis. This is not turned on by default.
    - **Serena Tilt-Only Wood Blinds can be excluded from plug-in support!**
        Ever since Lutron added native HomeKit support for the Serena wood blinds to the Lutron app, that functionality has been redundant. Now there is an option in the settings to exclude them from the plug-in. This is not turned on by default.
